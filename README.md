# sccs-infinite-maze

creates an infinite maze as you move the player. at least, the idea was to make it infinite... i'd have to check if it's infinite later. but i am not sure if i was able to completely make it work or if there was still some bugs left. The original maze "level" maze generator script is coming from youtube and it was not an infinite maze. i just added my own version of infinite terrain by using what i learned from Craig Perko and Holistic3D and Sebastian Lague and their terrain youtube series. The maze is made of simple cubes currently. The goal was to make a viable option of very small mazes in order to use the same C# to javascriptEcma5 terrain generation for void expanse. I have a couple of void expanse planet terrain tryout videos that i will upload later on youtube but it wasn't working as expected yet.

The SimplexNoise.cs script is coming from Unify Wiki here https://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Tileable_Noise
