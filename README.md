# sccs-infinite-maze

creates an infinite maze as you move the player. but i am not sure if i was able to completely make it work or if there was still some bugs left. The original maze scripts i believe are from youtube and it is not an infinite maze. I think i just added the code of the infinite terrain of Holistic3D from youtube. The maze is made of simple cubes currently. Showing series of pictures soon.
