# sccs-infinite-maze

creates an infinite maze as you move the player. but i am not sure if i was able to completely make it work or if there was still some bugs left. The original maze "level" maze generator script is coming from youtube and it was not an infinite maze. i just added my own version of infinite terrain by using what i learned from Craig Perko and Holistic3D and Sebastian Lague and their terrain youtube series. The maze is made of simple cubes currently.
